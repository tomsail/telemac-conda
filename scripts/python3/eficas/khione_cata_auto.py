of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (roughly the mean distance
from the Sun to the Earth). The solar constant includes all types of
solar radiation, not just the visible light. It is measured by
satellite as being 1.361 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m$^2$) at solar
minimum and approximately 0.1~\% greater (roughly 1.362 kW/m$^2$) at
solar maximum.
The solar "constant" is not a physical constant in scientific
sense; that is, it is not like the Planck constant or the speed of
light, which are absolutely constant in physics. The solar constant is
merely an average of the actually varying value. It has been shown to
vary in the past 400 years over a range of less than 0.2~\%.""",
