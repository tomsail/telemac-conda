\section{Purpose}
%
The purpose of this test is to assess the accuracy of \textsc{Sisyphe} at
reproducing the bed evolution in an alluvial channel bend under unsteady-flow
conditions. The mechanics of sediment transport in channel bends, frequently
appearing in natural rivers, are much more complex than that in straight
channels. The complexity is twofold. On the one hand, the sediment transport in
a channel bend is subject not only to longitudinal transport but also to
transverse transport and transverse sorting by the secondary flow inherently
associated with bends. On the other hand, the unsteadiness of flow in natural
rivers certainly has some effects on the structure of the flow field, thereby
affecting the motion of sediment particles.

This test is the experimental setup (RUN 5) proposed by Yen and Lee (1995). In
this case, the bed evolution of a 180$^{\circ}$ channel bed with an initial
flat bottom is computed for a triangular-shaped $300$ min\. hydrograph.
Numerical results are validated by measured contours of bed evolution after at
the end of the experience and by measured bottom elevations at two different
cross sections (90$^{\circ}$ and 180$^{\circ}$). This validation case can be
performed for uniform or graded sediment distribution.
%
\section{Problem setup}
%
The flume consists of a straight section of $11.5$ m long, a $180^{\circ}$ bend
of $4.0$ m radius and a downstream straight section of $11.5$ m long, with a
constant slope in flow direction equal to $0.002$. The width of the flume
channel is $1.0$ m. A triangular-shaped inflow hydrograph with an initial
discharge of $Q=0.02$ m$^3/$s, a water depth at the outflow of $h = 0.0544$ m
and a peak discharge of equal to $0.053$ m$^3/$s (water depth $h=0.103$m) at $T
= 100$ min is used, see Figure~\ref{fig:hydro}. After $T = 100$ min, the inflow
discharge is reduced linearly until it reached the initial values at the end of
the experiment ($T = 300$ min).

The sediment of the experiment has a median diameter of $D_{50}=1$ mm. Five
sediment classes with diameters $D=0.31, 0.64, 1.03, 1.69$ and $3.36$ mm are
chosen to reproduce the sediment distribution of the experiment. An initial
distribution of 20\% for each class is adopted.
 The Engelund-Hansen formula is adopted to estimate the sediment transport
 capacity of the channel. The slope effect and the secondary currents
 correction are accounted for this test. The influence of the slope effect on
 the the direction of the bedload transport is accounted through the Talmon
 formula, with $\beta_2=0.85$. The influence of the slope effect on the the
 magnitude of the bedload transport is accounted through the Soulsby formula,
 with an friction angle of $35^{\circ}$
The default value of $\alpha=1$ is used for the secondary currents parameter,
therefore the Engelund parameter $A=7$.
The Continuous Vertical Sorting Model has been choosed as layer model. The
total thickness of the $20$ cm is maximal discretised by 100 sections. For the
active layer thickness the formulation of Malcherek has been selected.
Initially a uniform distribution is assumed.

A friction closure relationship, based on the Nikuradse roughness length is
adopted to account for the bed resistance. For this case, $k_s=3.5$ mm
($\approx 3\times D_{50}$) and the Elder model is specified to parameterize the
turbulent eddy viscosity.
The critical Shields parameter is set at $0.047$ and the bed porosity is
$0.375$.

\section{Numerical setup}
%
Numerical simulations were conducted on an unstructured, triangular finite
element mesh with $3230$ elements and $1799$ nodes and a mean grid size of the
order of $0.20$ m (Figure~\ref{fig:mesh}).  As initial condition, a fully
developed (stationary) flow with a constant water-depth $h = 0.0544$m and
discharge $0.02$ m$^3/$s is imposed and the bottom has a constant slope in flow
direction equal to $0.002$.

 \caption{Finite element discretization of the bend.}\label{fig:mesh}
\end{figure}

The time step is set to $0.5$ s. For a mean velocity in the range $[0.37-0.53]$
m/s and a mean grid size of the order of $0.2$ m, the mean Courant number
varies between $0.6$ and $1.3$.

\section{Results}
%
Numerical results of the normalized bed evolution are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:results1}. Morphological changes exhibit the expected patterns
of erosion and sedimentation at the channel bend, with the presence of a point
bar along the inner-bank and a deeper channel along the outer-bank of the bend.
The computed bed changes are in agreement with the measured data. Without
accounting for the secondary flow effect, one cannot obtain such reasonable
results.
Numerical and observed bottom profiles at cross sections 90$^{\circ}$ and
180$^{\circ}$ are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:results2} for a total time equal
to $5$ hs.
In Figure~\ref{fig:results3} the comparison of measured and simulated mean
diameter for the cross section 90$^{\circ}$ is presented. Both simulation and
measurement show the expected coarser sediment at the outer bend and the finer
sediment at the inner bend.

%The python script compared measurements and simulation at both cross sections.
%One simulated bottom evolution after 5 hours can be seen in figure XXXXX
