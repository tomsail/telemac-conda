\section{Purpose}

This case is an example of the use of the O$_2$ module of \waqtel coupled with
\telemac{2D}.

\section{Description}

A square basin at rest is considered (length and width = 10~m)
with flat bathymetry and elevation at 0~m.

\section{Computational options}

\subsection{Mesh}

The triangular mesh is composed of 272 triangular elements and 159 nodes
(see Figure \ref{fig:waq2d_o2:mesh}).

\subsection{Physical parameters}

No diffusion neither for hydrodynamics or tracers.\\

The O$_2$ module is activated by setting \telkey{WATER QUALITY PROCESS} = 2
in the \telemac{2D} \telkey{STEERING FILE}.\\

3 tracers are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item dissolved O$_2$,
\item NH$_4$ load,
\item organic load.
\end{itemize}

Only the following water quality parameters have been changed
in the \waqtel \telkey{STEERING FILE} compared to the default values:
\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{K2 REAERATION COEFFICIENT} = 0.3,
\item \telkey{FORMULA FOR COMPUTING K2} = 0 (i.e. $k_2$ is constant),
\item \telkey{O2 SATURATION DENSITY OF WATER (CS)} = 9~mgO$_2$/l ($C_s$ is constant),
\item \telkey{WATER TEMPERATURE} = 20$^\circ$C (which is the mean temperature of water).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initial and Boundary Conditions}

The initial water depth is 2~m with a fluid at rest.\\
%
The initial values for tracers are homogeneous:\\
([O$_2$], [L], [NH$_4$]) =
(5~mgO$_2$/l, 3~mgO$_2$/l, 0.01~mgNH$_4$/l).\\
%
There are only closed lateral boundaries with free slip condition and no
friction at the bottom.

\subsection{General parameters}

The time step is 4~s for a simulated period of 86,400~s =~1~day.

\subsection{Numerical parameters}

Basin at rest (no advection nor diffusion).

\section{Results}

Figure \ref{fig:waq2d_o2:res} shows the 3 tracers evolution along time.
All of them vary with time (even NH$_4$ load).

\section{Conclusion}

The O$_2$ module of \waqtel can be coupled with \telemac{2D}.
