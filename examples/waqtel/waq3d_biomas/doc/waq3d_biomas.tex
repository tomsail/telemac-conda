\section{Purpose}

This case is an example of the use of the BIOMASS module of \waqtel coupled with
\telemac{3D}.

\section{Description}

A square basin at rest is considered (length and width = 10~m)
with flat bathymetry and elevation at 0~m.

\section{Computational options}

\subsection{Mesh}

The triangular mesh is composed of 272 triangular elements and 159 nodes
(see Figure \ref{fig:waq3d_biomas:mesh}).

 \label{fig:waq3d_biomas:mesh}
\end{figure}

To build the 3D mesh of prisms, 3 planes are regularly spaced over the vertical.
The vertical mesh between nodes of coordinates (-5 ; 0) to (5 ; 0) can be
seen on Figure \ref{fig:waq3d_biomas:mesh_section}.

 \label{fig:waq3d_biomas:mesh_section}
\end{figure}

This number of 3 planes has been changed to decrease the CPU time to run this
example in the global validation process,
as nothing seems to happen over the vertical
(checked for 11 planes with differences over the vertical lower than
10$^{-15}$).

\subsection{Physical parameters}

The BIOMASS module is activated by setting \telkey{WATER QUALITY PROCESS} = 3
in the \telemac{3D} \telkey{STEERING FILE}.\\

5 tracers are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item phytoplanktonic biomass (PHY),
\item dissolved mineral phosphorus (PO$_4$),
\item degradable phosphorus non assimilated by phytoplankton (POR),
\item dissolved mineral nitrogen assimilated by phytoplankton (NO$_3$),
\item degradable nitrogen assimilated by phyto phytoplankton (NOR),
\end{itemize}

Only the following water quality parameters have been changed
in the \waqtel \telkey{STEERING FILE} compared to the default values:
\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{METHOD OF COMPUTATION OF RAY EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT} = 2 (Moss formula, Secchi depth is unknown),
\item \telkey{VEGETAL TURBIDITY COEFFICIENT WITHOUT PHYTO} = 0.005~m$^{-1}$,
\item \telkey{RATE OF TRANSFORMATION OF NOR TO NO3} = 0.35~d$^{-1}$,
\item \telkey{SUNSHINE FLUX DENSITY ON WATER SURFACE} = 0.01~W/m$^2$,
\item \telkey{WATER TEMPERATURE} = 20$^\circ$C (which is the mean temperature of water).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initial and Boundary Conditions}

The initial water depth is 2~m with a fluid at rest.\\
%
The initial values for tracers are homogeneous:\\
([PHY],[PO4],[POR],[NO3],[NOR]) =
(50~$\mu$gChlA/l, 3~mg/l, 0.01~mg/l, 2.9~mg/l, 9~mg/l).\\
%
There are only closed lateral boundaries with free slip condition and no
friction at the bottom.

\subsection{General parameters}

The time step is 1~h = 3,600~s for a simulated period of 8,760~h = 365~days.

\subsection{Numerical parameters}

Basin at rest (no advection nor diffusion for hydrodynamics).\\

The advection scheme for the tracers is LIPS (new default value since release 8.1) activated
with the combo \telkey{SCHEME FOR ADVECTION OF TRACERS} = 5
and \telkey{SCHEME OPTION FOR ADVECTION OF TRACERS} = 4.

Moreover, the \telkey{ACCURACY FOR DIFFUSION OF TRACERS} is to be set to 10$^{-15}$ to
get mass balance with a good accuracy.
For this example, the current default value = 10$^{-8}$ is not enough.

\section{Results}

Figure \ref{fig:waq3d_biomas:res} shows the 5 tracers evolution along time.
All of them rather quickly reach an asymptote.

\section{Conclusion}

The BIOMASS module of \waqtel can be coupled with \telemac{3D}.
