\chapter{tracer\_decrease}

\section{Purpose}

This case is an example of the use of the degradation law of \waqtel coupled with \telemac{2D}.

\section{Description}

A square basin at rest is considered (length and width = 10~m)
with flat bathymetry and elevation at 0~m.

\section{Computational options}

\subsection{Mesh}

The triangular mesh is composed of 272 triangular elements and 159 nodes
(see Figure \ref{fig:tracer_decrease:mesh}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Physical parameters}

The degradation law is activated by setting \telkey{WATER QUALITY PROCESS} = 17
in the \telemac{2D} \telkey{STEERING FILE}.\\

Several tracers are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item the 1$^{\rm{st}}$ one without any degradation law,
\item the 2$^{\rm{nd}}$ one with a 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order law for bacterial
  degradation with a $T_{90}$ coefficient = 6~h,
\item the 3$^{\rm{rd}}$ one with a 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order degradation law with
  a constant of tracer kinetic degradation = 0.3833333333333333~h$^{-1}$,
\item the 4$^{\rm{th}}$ one with a 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order degradation law with
  a constant of tracer kinetic degradation = 9.2~day$^{-1}$,
\item the 5$^{\rm{th}}$ one with a degradation law implemented by user.
  As an example, a 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order degradation law with
  a constant of tracer kinetic degradation = 0.00010648148148148147~s$^{-1}$
  has been implemented
  with the help of \telfile{USER\_CALCS2D\_DEGRADATION} subroutine.
\end{itemize}

The $T_{90}$ or $k_1$ coefficients can be specified with the keyword
\telkey{COEFFICIENT 1 FOR LAW OF TRACERS DEGRADATION}
(one per tracer, expressed in hours for tracer 2, in h$^{-1}$ for tracer 3,
in day$^{-1}$ for tracer 4).

\subsection{Initial and Boundary Conditions}

The initial water depth is 2~m with a fluid at rest.\\
%
The initial concentrations are homogeneous
= (100, 200, 200, 200, 200).\\
%
There are only closed lateral boundaries with free slip condition and no
friction at the bottom.

\subsection{General parameters}

The time step is 10~s for a simulated period of 86,400~s =~1~day.

\subsection{Numerical parameters}

Basin at rest (no advection nor diffusion).
No diffusion neither for hydrodynamics or tracers.\\

2 default values for the diffusion of the tracers are modified
in the \telemac{2D} \telkey{STEERING FILE} :
\begin{itemize}
\item \telkey{ACCURACY FOR DIFFUSION OF TRACERS} = 10$^{-10}$ (current default = 10$^{-6}$),
\item \telkey{IMPLICITATION COEFFICIENT OF TRACERS} = 1 (current default = 0.6).
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

Figure \ref{fig:tracer_decrease:res} shows the tracers evolution along time for the tracers numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5
(with degradation law).
The analytical solution is also plotted with circle markers.

\section{Conclusion}

\waqtel is able to model a 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order degradation law when coupled with
\telemac{2D}.
