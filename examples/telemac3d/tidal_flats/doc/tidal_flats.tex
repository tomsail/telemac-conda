\chapter{tidal\_flats}

This test case validates the modelling of cohesive sediments with \telemac{3D}
solved with a vertical implicit-advection scheme (tridiagonal matrix solver)
for diffusion and settling velocity
(\telkey{ADVECTION-DIFFUSION SCHEME WITH SETTLING VELOCITY = 1}).
In particular, this example deals with sediment transport processes with wetting
and drying zones.\\

Even though this model setup is still valid, new features and bug fixes are now
available for the new sediment transport and bed evolution module \gaia of the
\telemacsystem.
Therefore, for newer model implementations, we strongly suggest to use
\telemac{3D} coupled with \gaia for sediment transport and bed evolution
processes in 3D.\\

\gaia test cases “hippodrome-t3d“, “rouse-t3d“, “tidal\_flats-t3d“ and
“turbidity-t3d“ provide examples of coupling \telemac{3D} coupled with
\gaia to account for cohesive sediment transport processes.
