This test case validates the coupling of \telemac{3D} with \sisyphe
for bedload transport processes.\\

Even though this model setup is still valid, new features and bug fixes are now
available for the new sediment transport and bed evolution module \gaia of the
\telemacsystem.
Therefore, for newer model implementations, we strongly suggest to use
\telemac{3D} coupled with \gaia for sediment transport and bed evolution
processes in 3D.\\

\gaia test cases “bosse-t3d” and “hippodrome-t3d” provide examples of coupling
\telemac{3D} with \gaia to account for bedload sediment transport.
