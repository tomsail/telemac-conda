This test case assesses the capabilities of the \telemacsystem at solving
sediment transport processes that accounts for mixed sediments
(cohesive and non-cohesive) within \telemac{3D}.\\

Even though this model setup is still valid, new features and bug fixes are now
available for the new sediment transport and bed evolution module \gaia of the
\telemacsystem.
Therefore, for newer model implementations, we strongly suggest to use
\telemac{3D} coupled with \gaia for sediment transport and bed evolution
processes in 3D.\\

\gaia test case “hippodrome-t3d” provides an example of coupling mixed sediment
computations using \telemac{3D} coupled with \gaia.
