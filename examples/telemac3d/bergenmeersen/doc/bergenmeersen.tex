\chapter{Bergenmeersen test case}

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this test-case is to test the culvert feature in \telemac{3D}
with a quantitative comparison to measurements of the flow rates through the
culverts and the water levels on each side of the culverts.

\section{Description}

A recent (2013) example of the implementation of a Flood Control Area (FCA) with
a controlled reduced
tide (CRT) system is located in Bergenmeersen.
The ring dike that surrounds the FCA has a crest level of 8 m TAW
(Tweede Algemene Waterpassing, the reference level in Belgium;
0 m TAW corresponds to the average sea level at low water in Ostende port)
and the overflow dike has a crest level of 6.8 m TAW.
The configuration used for the inlet and outlet culverts is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure1}.
Three outlet culverts were built to add to other older three outlet culverts
that existed in the area.
Above the new outlet culverts, six new inlet culverts were built and at their
entrance weirs (i.e. wooden beams)
with different heights were added (Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure1} and
Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure2}).
At each inlet and outlet culvert the flow is separated into two parts at the
entrance of the culvert
by a kind of pilar and then converges again right after this pilar.
Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure3} shows an example of the trash screens
that are present.
Table \ref{tab:bergenmeersen_table1} gives an overview of the characteristics of
these new inlet and outlet culverts.

To test the culvert feature implemented in \telemac{3D}, this new configuration
of in- and outlet culverts is tested.
The quality of the results can be assessed compared to measurements of the mean
water levels inside the flood control area,
outlet discharges, inlet discharges and mean water levels in the river side.

% Experimental results (if needed)
\subsection{Measurements}
The quality of the numerical results can be assessed compared to measurements of
the mean water levels inside the flood control area,
outlet discharges, inlet discharges and mean water levels in the river side.
Measurements were perfomed by Flanders Hydraulic Research in Bergenmeersen
within a 13 hour campaign during the 10th September, 2013.
They obtained water levels in front of the culverts in the Scheldt
and in the floodplain sides and discharges for the inlet and outlet culverts.
The model results for this period will be compared with the measurements.

\section{Computational options}

\subsection{Mesh}
The mesh of the computational domain is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure4}.
The mesh is cut out of an early version of the Scaldis model.
It has a resolution of about 8 m in the river side, and 10 m in the floodplain.
Five horizontal layers are uniformly imposed in the model.
Detailed bathymetric/topographic data from 2013 is available and used for this model.

\label{fig:bergenmeersen_figure4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Initial and boundary conditions}
The water levels in the Scheldt river are obtained at the Wetteren tidal station.
These values are used as the downstream boundary condition for the hydrodynamic model.
Upstream a discharge boundary condition is imposed.

\subsection{Numerical parameters}
The simulation time is about one day (10th September 2014) corresponding to the
time period for which measurements of mean water levels were available.
The time step is set to 5~s, providing, together with the chosen mesh
resolution, a stable simulation.

The bottom friction is taken into account in the model through the Manning
Stricklerâ€™s parameter $n$, set to 0.02~s.m$^{-1/3}$.
The horizontal and vertical turbulence viscosity coefficients are both set to
0.01~m$^2$.s$^{-1}$,
with Smagorinsky turbulence model in the horizontal directions and mixing length
model in the vertical direction.

\subsection{Culvert parameters}
Table \ref{tab:bergenmeersen_table2} shows the file that the user has to give to
\telemac{3D} in order to take
into account the culverts for this FCA with CRT in the Bergenmeersen test case.
Besides this new structure, there were already in the area three outlet sluices
also represented in the input text file as outlet 3 to outlet 6
(information for these outlet sluices is obtained from the Patrimoniumdatabank W\&Z).
Once again the different head loss coefficients are used to calibrate the model
with the experimental data.
Most of the parameters are maintained comparatively with the Lippenbroek test case.
But there are some exceptions, given the fact that the inlet and outlet culvert
configurations are also different.
For instance the head loss coefficients at the entrance of the inlet are
increased in order to take
into account the effect of the flow being split into two parts by a pillar.
Following the expression given by Carlier (1972), the head loss due to the
presence of pillars is about Cp $\approx$ 0.4
and therefore CE1 becomes CE1 = C1+Cp.
There is also at the exit of the outlet sluices the separation of the flow into
two parts.
This effect is taken into account in the head loss due to a valve, increasing
the value for CV.
Also during the measurement campaign, the trash screens at the inlet sluices are
not cleaned and therefore this coefficient is increased both for the inlet and
outlet sluices.

\section{Results}

Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure5} shows the differences in water level in
the river in front of the in- and outlet construction of Bergenmeersen.
This figure shows that it is difficult to get the water levels in this model
correct.
The downstream water level boundary of this small model is not located at the
same location as the Wetteren tidal measurement station, but more upstream.
Keeping this in mind, Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure6} shows the difference
between measured and modeled water levels in the floodplain.
The water level in the model follows a similar path as the measured water level.
Given the complicated construction (in terms of translating this to an equation
for discharge)
of the in- and outlet structure, these results are a good approximation of reality.
In Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure7} we see that the outlet discharge
computed by the model fits fairly well the experimental data even if the
numerical results overestimate the measurements around 12~h.
Regarding the inlet discharge, Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure8} shows that
the computed discharges are overestimated by the model, resulting on the
overestimation seen in the mean water level in the FCA.
A possible explanation for the discrepancies is that the inlet sluices have
gates incorporated and in this test case, it is considered that these gates are
completely open.
We have heard that in reality this is not the case and that the opening of these
gates is changed several times over the last two years.
The purpose of these gates is to close the area and prevent water from entering.
There is no information on the openings of these gates at the time of this 13~h
measurement campaign.

The normalized root mean square error is calculated for the mean water levels, outlet and inlet discharges (Table \ref{tab:bergenmeersen_table3}).

\end{tabular}\end{center}
\end{table}

In Figure \ref{fig:bergenmeersen_figure9}, the flow types that predominate
through the inlet and outlet culverts are presented.
While for the former, flow types 2, 3 and 4 predominate, for the latter flow
types 2 and 4 are the ones that occur the most.

\end{figure}

The results show that given some uncertainty like the representation of ditches
and creeks in the topo-bathymetry of the model
or the complexity of the in- and outlet structure, numerical results fit fairly
well with data,
both for the mean water levels and inlet and outlet discharges.
