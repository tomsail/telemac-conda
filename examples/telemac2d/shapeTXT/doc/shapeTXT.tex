\chapter{Shape file to define bathymetry (shapeTXT)}

\section{Purpose}
This is an example of the use of a text file coming from a shapefile to define
a specific bathymetry in some areas.
For an example of the construction of the text file from a shapefile containing
polygons, one can see the notebook {\it shape\_file\_reader.ipynb}.
The file shape.txt defines a square and a triangle that are read by
\telfile{user\_corfon} subroutine.
The bathymetry is set to 3.9~m in the square and 2~m in the triangle.
