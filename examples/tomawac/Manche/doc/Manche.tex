\section{Purpose}
%
This test case has been exhibited from an old version (V5P4), the reference
case at this time was called r2d.V1P3. It has got mainly one interest, to
compare results from old versions to the new version.

\section{Description of the problem}
We simulate the storm that occured in 1990 in Manche. This test was a test
described in the validation of \tomawac 1.0 \cite{Benoit1996_3}. Because of many
changes in the code it had been abandonned. It now works with the new version
but not in parallel because of the fortran user that sets the boundary. 

We discretize with 25 frequencies and 12 directions. The minimal frequency is
0.04177248 and the frequential ratio 1.1. The mesh is shown on picture
\ref{figmanchemesh}, as we are interested in storm in the Manche the mesh is
finer around the manche. 
The time step is 300s and we simulate during 14 days.

In fact we are going to work with spherical coordinate so the 'real' bathymetry
will be the one showed on Figure \ref{realbathymanche}. In the code if the
bathymetry is more than -10 m, it is set to -10 m.

We take into account the wind through a file that gives the wind in all point
of the mesh every 6 hours. On this point, in the original file the time was
given with a deprecated format, so we took the wind from the results of the
old simulation which was given in a new format (number of seconds after 0).

Nowadays time format is given through a number \textit{YYYYMMDDHHMMNN}, and it
used to be given by MDDHH. As we kept the fortran user to describe boundaries
conditions one will read this format in the keyword \textit{DATE DE DEBUT DU
  CALCUL = 1161500} for \textit{1990 01 16 15:00:00}

\section{Results and Comments}

If one run the validation with old results, one will see a difference of
30\% wave heigth result, it is only on a few points (see
figure\ref{figmanchedif}) and it does not spread on all the results, it can be
explained by a bug corrected in characteristic method on boundaries some years
ago.

\label{figmanchedif}
\end{figure}

When we observe global results, we would say that there are no difference
between reference and new result (see \ref{figmanchehm0} \ref{figmanchehm02}
and \ref{figmanchehm0v1P3}). To run validation we have updated the reference,
it is a result of the version 7.2

As the calculation is made in spherical coordinates but the initial mesh is
done in cartesian coordinates. \tomawac calculates a conversion through Fortran
user. The result is a little bit different if we take the conversion from the
coordinate of the old version because of simple precision in the coordinate.
That is the reason of the difference between last comparison when running
validation.
