\chapter{Bottom friction}
%

% - Purpose & Problem description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\section{Purpose}
%
This test case aims at testing the effect of friction coefficients used in
\tomawac, one acting upon energy whereas the other one acts upon the mean
directional frequency. This test case is an inheritage of a comparison between
Cowadis and \tomawac. There is no measure to validate the test, it is only a non
regression testing.

\section{Description of the problem}
The waves are let freely propagate in a large body of water. The swell should
loose some energy and its frequency should change only under the effect of
friction bottom (the boundary conditions may be ignored because the domain is
very wide).

The expression that is used for computing the friction in \tomawac is as
follows:
\begin{equation}
Q_{bf}(\theta,\omega)=-\Gamma \left(\frac{\sigma}{g.\sinh(kd)}\right)F(\theta,\omega)
\end{equation}
Where $\Gamma$, the \telkey{BOTTOM FRICTION COEFFICIENT}, is taken equal to
0.038, its default value.

\section{Geometry and mesh}
The computational domain is a 100~km by 25~km rectangle and the flat bottom
elevation is taken equal to 5m.

The mesh is made with 492 nodes (80 on the boundary) and 902 triangles.

% - Physical parameters:
%     This part specifies the geometry, details all the physical parameters
%     used to describe both porous media (soil model in particularly) and
%     solute characteristics (dispersion/diffusion coefficients, soil <=> pollutant interactions...)
%
\section{Numerical parameters}
%
Time duration is 30000~s, time step is equal to 100~s, the spectro-angular
mesh has 24 angles and 25 frequences spread on a geometric progression common
ratio 1.1 with a minimum of 0.056447393.

\section{Initial and Boundary Conditions}
%
For both conditions, we take a Jonswap spectrum with a 1~m significant wave
heigth, a pic frequency of 0.1 The angular distribution function follows a
$\cos^{2s} \theta$ distribution with an angular spreading of 6 and a mean
direction of 0.


% - Results:
%     We comment in this part the numerical results against the reference ones,
%     giving understanding keys and making assumptions when necessary.

\section{Results}
In this case we just verify that we still have the same results as the ones
obtained during the comparison with Cowadis \cite{cowadis}.
