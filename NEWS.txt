TELEMAC-3D: fix a bug with TKE computation with Spalart Allmaras turbulence model

GAIA : introduction of this new module, that aims at replacing both SISYPHE and SEDI3D.
  The goal is to have:
    - one sediment module only, instead of 2
    - one bed model for 2D and 3D, without limitations on the number of classes of
      sand and mud
    - the suspension fluxes computed in TELEMAC2D or TELEMAC3D depending on the
      dimension (resolution of a tracer equation)
    - all the sediment evolutions written in terms of mass (instead of volume)
    - no more standalone option for the 2D hydrodynamics inside the sediment module
  In this first version of GAIA, the major developments were:
    - to write the 2D/3D bed model based on the sediment fluxes writtent in
      terms of mass
    - to use that bed model and in 2D and 3D
    - to make it compatible with wave effects when coupling with waves
    - to implement the suspension in 2D inside TELEMAC2D, and modify it in 3D to
      comply with GAIA
    - to introduce the coupling between NESTOR and GAIA
  At this stage, SISYPHE and SEDI3D can still be used in the system, but we advise the users
  to switch and start using GAIA as soon as possible. Indeed, the plan is to remove SISYPHE
  and SEDI3D from TELEMAC after one year of transition with GAIA.

TOMAWAC : The components of the stokes drift, the wave enhanced mixing,
the wave dissipation due to bottom friction and wave breaking,
the modified friction coefficient due to waves are now calculated in respectively,
uvstokes, fdissk, fbott3d, fdiss3d and fric3d subroutines. This calculation allow to
have a full coupling with telemac3d through a vortex force formalism : COUPLING WITH TOMAWACT3D

TOMAWAC : A new tests case has been added to test this new functionnality :
          - 3Dcoupling

TELEMAC3D : - The variables calculated by tomawac are taken into account for a real 3D coupling.
            - 3 new output graphic variables are avalaible US, VS, WS the thress components of stokes velocity.
	    - One new keyword BOTTOM FRICTION DUE TO WAVES, it allows to take into account the momentum lost by waves due to bottom friction.

Release V8P0R0 (19/12/2018)
===========================

- Python3: Adding handling of MED format in vvytel now xml can handle both
  serafin and MED format
- Python: Work in progress new folder for scripts (scripts/python3) contains
  Python3 compatible scripts. All the scripts have been reorganised and renames
  to follow PEP8 convention. A new set of examples in examples/python3 show how
  to use them. Also a notebook exist showing how to use the postel module
  (Post-Treatment module).
  The folder scripts/python27 is kept for backward compatibility.
  All new development will be in the python3 folder.
- TelApy: Adding API for TELEMAC-3D
- TELEMAC-3D: New Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Together with a DES option which uses also Spalart-Allmaras model.
- TELEMAC-3D: new default values for 4 keywords:
  - NON-HYDROSTATIC VERSION = YES,
  - LAW OF BOTTOM FRICTION = 0 (rather than 2, Chezy law),
  - ACCURACY FOR DIFFUSION OF TRACERS = 1.E-8 (rather than 1.E-6),
  - COEFFICIENT OF WIND INFLUENCE = 1.55E-6 (rather than 0.).
- TELEMAC-3D: fix the uncorrect reading of private arrays when present in the GEOMETRY FILE (bug since V7P2).
- TELEMAC-3D: fix the reading of the binary boundary data file.
- TELEMAC-3D with AED2 coupling: partial fixes (wrong loops to sweep arrays, computation of the real number of the bottom layer...).
- SISYPHE: Implementation of the Wilcock and Crowe formula for sediment closure relationship
- SISYPHE: Add new test case (WC_BOMC4) to validate the Wilcock and Crowe formula; including python scripts. This test case also illustrates how to recirculate sediment in a straight channel (typically used in experimental flumes).
- SISYPHE: Add new section in documentation plus several improvements

Release V7P3R0 (22/12/17)
===========================

- all modules: FORTRAN FILE can be a folder that contains several files,
  not a single file (but still possible)
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: fix the culvert formulation 1 so that
  it falls back to the siphon formulation in that specific case.
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: sources can also be assigned with global node numbers
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: Lambert 93 projection when modelling tide.
- TELEMAC-2D/TELEMAC-3D: Adding 7 extra harmonic constituents,
  for FES2014 tidal database (M3, M8, Msf, N4, S1, Sa, SSa).
- TELEMAC-3D: remove the option DIFFUS. This option was meant
  to remove the diffusion but it actually did not
  remove the diffusion on U,V. Besides, it could happen that when using
  DIFFUS=NO the source terms were not included in W and the tracers.
  We thus chose to remove this option altogether. From now on, to
  disable the diffusion the user can only set a zero diffusion coefficient.
- TELEMAC-3D: remove the option OPTDIF to keep only one formulation
  (OPTDIF could take the values 1 or 2 but the
  option 2 did not seem to bring improvements compared to the option 1.
  It was was not used in any test-case, neither documented so we only kept
  the option 1 in the code)
- TELEMAC-3D: modular CONDIM and BORD3D subroutines (initial conditions
  and boundary conditions). Simplification of the CONDIM subroutine
  (initial conditions + mesh transformation), now split into several
  subroutines which do various and separated treatments (e.g. initial
  conditions for water depths, velocities, tracers... or mesh
  transformation different from the classical sigma transformation).
  The user only needs to fill one short file per variable. No need to
  keep the whole CONDIM subroutine.
  For BORD3D, every specific treatment is implemented in a separate
  subroutine USER_BORD3D called by BORD3D (see examples to fill).
- ARTEMIS: Creation of free surface elevation (time/space varying) files.
- ARTEMIS: Removing the need to code within BORH (using LECLIM and
the BOUNDARY CONDITION FILE instead).
- ARTEMIS: Automated calculation of the phase for incident boundaries
  (in PHBOR), starting from the "node of attack" of the offshore wave,
  iteratively computed along both sides away from the attack node
  along the rest of the incident boundary.
- STBTEL: Now refining the boundary conditions as well as the mesh
  Available through the script convertert.py as well
- Addons: Adding vim-syntax for .cas and .dico files
- TELEMAC-2D: change computation of wall distance (used in
  Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model). The wall distance (WDIST) is now
  computed in parallel with a laplacian operator.
- TELEMAC-2D: new framework for automatic convergence studies
- TELEMAC-3D: coupling with the water quality library AED2.
- TOMAWAC: Automatic imposed spectrum on nested mesh.
- TOMAWAC: In order to better take into account boundary conditions Limwac is called at the end of the loop in time instead of beginning.
- TELEMAC-2D: I/O criteria of result file now homogenous with FE or FV (steered by time-step and
period for graphic output)
- TELEMAC-2D: Activation of source terms for FV (Mass and Momentum): so far only partially
implemented for mass source terms.
- TELEMAC-2D: New turbulence model (Spalart-Allmaras)
